Skills application 3

In this repository there are 4 existing files:
1) Skills Application 3 - this is your instruction text file that you will alter and push back to Github along with the other two files I ask you to submit
2) and 3) I did a quality check on the sequences from NCBI and if you open the files below it takes you to a graph with some varying metrics that basically tell us that we should clean the sequences up a bit but we'll talk about quality control later so these were included just in case you wanted to look at them but you don't need to do anything with them.
    - sars_R1_fastqc.html
    - sars_R2_fastqc.html
4) sarscov2.fasta - this is your reference genome
