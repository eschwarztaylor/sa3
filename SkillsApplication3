#Skills application 3 - taking the training wheels off!

#For this exercise you will obtain sequencing reads from Sars-CoV-2 and
#align them to the Sars-CoV-2 reference genome using bowtie2 (not bwa).
#As you see below I've given minimal instructions but the entire workflow is
#similar to what we did with bwa and the ecoli genome.

#your final product will consist of 3 things that should all be pushed to github:
# 1) this document that should be complete with commenting
#    (taking notes that have the # in front) and every piece of code you use.
# 2) your final launcher.slurm script for this assignment
# 3) a screenshot of Geneious with the reads mapped.

Instructions
# Obtain the forward (R1) and reverse (R2) fastq.gz reads from
# https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR14230036 (under "original format")
# Do not download these to your computer - download into Stampede2 directly

# Obtain the Sars-CoV-2 reference genome named sarscov2.fasta from the git
# repository for this assignment and get it into Stampede2

# Map the R1 and R2 sequence files to the reference genome using bowtie2

# convert the .sam output into a .bam file using samtools

# visualize your mapped reads in Geneious

# take a screenshot of Geneious with mapped reads obvious

# upload this text file with your added notes and code,
# your launcher.slurm job script, and
# your Geneious screenshot to the github assignment
# Done!
